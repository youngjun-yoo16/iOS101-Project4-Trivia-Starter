## Notes

Fetching real data from the Open Trivia Database API presented a challenging yet enjoyable task. Although we had practiced this once during a lab session, this time we needed to handle responses in the form of arrays, creating the necessary structs and data types, which proved to be somewhat challenging. Furthermore, employing Decodable and the URLSession library to retrieve data from a remote server was an interesting aspect of the project.
